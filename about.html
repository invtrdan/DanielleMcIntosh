            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello World! I'm Danielle McIntosh, a senior Computer Science student at Howard University with a vibrant passion that sits at the intersection of technology and creativity. Born and raised in the charming city of Kingston, Jamaica, I bring a blend of cultural richness and innovative thinking to the world of computing.</p>
            <p>My journey through Computer Science is fueled by my fascination with Artificial Intelligence and Data Science â€” fields that I believe are the frontiers of our future. But beyond the algorithms and data, I find joy in the creative aspects of technology, whether it's designing intuitive mobile apps or crafting responsive websites.</p>
            <p>Between my studies, I indulge in the simple pleasures of life. I'm an ardent coffee shop enthusiast, musician and pianist. I also have a profound love for travel. It's an avenue that opens up new horizons, bringing with it the excitement of exploring diverse cultures and landscapes. Traveling enriches my perspective, allowing me to weave together the tapestry of global experiences with my personal and professional growth.</p>
            <p>As I approach the culmination of my studies at Howard University, I am excited about the opportunities that await and the challenges that beckon.</p>
